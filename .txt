To create a dynamic update product form in React.js that integrates with both `calculator.html` buttons and `admin.html` buttons, we need to:

1. Create a React component for the update product form.
2. Add handlers for the buttons in `calculator.html` to interact with the form.
3. Integrate the form with `admin.html` using an appropriate method (e.g., linking to the form with a specific product ID).

Here's the step-by-step implementation:

### Step 1: Create a React Component for the Update Product Form

First, set up a React component for the update product form:

```jsx
```

### Step 2: Handle Button Clicks from `calculator.html`

Modify `calculator.html` to add functionality that communicates with the React component:

```html
<!-- calculator.html -->

```

### Step 3: Integrate with `admin.html`

Add the link in `admin.html` to update a specific product:

```html

```

### Step 4: Main React Component to Handle Update Product Form

Finally, create a main React component to render the form and handle submissions:

```jsx
```

This setup ensures that when buttons are clicked in `calculator.html` or `admin.html`, they navigate to the `updateproduct.html` page with the product ID. The React component will fetch the product details and allow updating. When the form is submitted, it updates the local storage and redirects back to the admin page.
