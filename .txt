To integrate a form for writing new messages or replying to existing messages within your current `message.html` file, you can follow the steps below. This approach ensures that the new form functionality is added without removing the existing code or features.

### Steps to Add Message Form:

1. **Add the Form in the HTML:**
   Place the form at an appropriate location within your HTML structure where users can easily access it. Typically, it can be added at the top or bottom of the message section.

2. **Update JavaScript to Handle Form Submission:**
   Add JavaScript to handle the form submission, including fetching the data and updating the messages.

3. **Preserve Existing Functionality:**
   Ensure that existing features like dynamic fetching and rendering of messages are not affected.

Here is the complete `message.html` file with the added form and necessary JavaScript updates:

```html
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Form Added**: The form for sending new messages is added before the existing messages section.
2. **JavaScript Updates**:
   - **Fetching Messages**: Added function `fetchMessages()` to fetch and render messages.
   - **Form Submission Handling**: Added an event listener to handle form submission, send the new message to the server, and refresh the messages.
