Let's streamline and ensure there are no redundant sections in the code provided. Hereâ€™s a cleaned-up version of both the backend and frontend JavaScript code:

### Backend JavaScript (server.js)

```javascript
```

### Frontend JavaScript (marketing.js)

```javascript
```

### Explanation

1. **Backend JavaScript**:
   - Consolidates product management (create, update, delete) into clean, individual endpoints.
   - Handles search functionality based on various product attributes.

2. **Frontend JavaScript**:
   - Uses `DOMContentLoaded` to ensure the script runs after the DOM is fully loaded.
   - Avoids duplication in event listeners and functions.
   - Consolidates product display and cart management into reusable functions.

This cleanup should help keep your code organized and eliminate redundancy. If you need further adjustments, feel free to ask!
